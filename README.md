### ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Application that generates **fake Danish personal data** (CPR, names, addresses, phone numbers) for software testing.  
Originally built in PHP + MariaDB, now converted to **Python + MySQL**.  
The focus is **testing** â€” not development â€” using unit, integration, and end-to-end approaches.  

---
## ðŸ§© Domains and Dependencies
### **0. Conversion Domain**
**Goal:** Prepare a consistent and testable Python + MySQL backend.  
- Convert backend logic from PHP to Python.  
- Connect to MySQL using `mysql.connector`.  
- Recreate endpoints in Flask (or FastAPI?).  
- Verify API outputs and database access manually.  
**â†’ Output:** Working baseline system for all subsequent testing domains.

---
### **1. Unit Domain**
**Goal:** Verify correctness of individual backend functions.  
- Test CPR, gender, date-of-birth generation.  
- Test address and phone logic.  
- No database or API involved (pure Python).  
- Apply black-box and white-box techniques.  
**â†’ Output:** Reliable backend logic and full code coverage.

---

### **2. Integration Domain**
**Goal:** Verify data flow across backend + database + API.  
- Ensure correct responses from endpoints (Flask/FastAPI).  
- Check consistency between CPR and date-of-birth.  
- Validate address data from MySQL.  
- Use Postman + pytest integration tests.  
**â†’ Output:** Backend and API work as a unified system.

---

### **3. System / End-to-End Domain**
**Goal:** Validate the entire system through the frontend.  
- Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate user actions.  
- Verify that UI displays API data correctly.  
- Include error handling and edge cases.  
**â†’ Output:** Fully functional fake data generator tested as a whole.
